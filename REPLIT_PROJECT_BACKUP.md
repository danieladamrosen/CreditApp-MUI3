*Backup created: June 10, 2025*

## Project Overview
Complete Credit Report Analysis application with Donald Blair's authentic credit data (55 accounts, 17 negative). 
Built with React, TypeScript, Material-UI, and Tailwind CSS following CRC (Credit Repair Cloud) design system.

## Key Features Implemented

### ✅ UI/UX Enhancements
- **Font System**: Lato font (CRC official) throughout except AI scan button (Material-UI)
- **Color Scheme**: Authentic CRC blue (#4A69BD) for buttons, bright blue (#2563eb) for AI components
- **Header**: "Credit Report Analysis" with client name "Donald Blair", non-sticky scroll behavior
- **Modal Positioning**: AI success modal centered with dark overlay, same position as scanning animation
- **Auto-scroll**: Perfected to show Quick Start box with 30px spacing above

### ✅ AI Scanning Interface
